// Link list is technically a type of tree but with just one single path,
// and it's linear there's only one way to go from top to bottom 


// Is that a node can only point to a child as you can see all the arrows point down.


// There's always one entry point which is the root 
// but nodes don't really have to reference their parent



// root                10 
//                   / |  \
// parent          15  |   20
//                /    |     \
// child       25      50      30

// leaf
// sibling
